# wazo-test-helpers

Common test helpers used in Wazo.

## To install

pip install wazo-test-helpers

## Environment variables

### Logging

Tests that use the AssetLaunchTestCase class will be stripped of some logs. To restore the default
logging levels, set the environment variable:

    TEST_LOGS=verbose

### Docker containers management

In some cases, it is easier to manage Docker containers manually or via an external script. When
doing that, the tests must be told to not manage the containers and this is done with the variable:

    TEST_DOCKER=ignore

To add volumes without modifying original file (used by zuul):

    WAZO_TEST_DOCKER_OVERRIDE_EXTRA=docker-compose.custom.yml

To enable the docker logs dumping:

    WAZO_TEST_DOCKER_LOGS_ENABLED=1

To choose the directory used for docker logs dumping:

    WAZO_TEST_DOCKER_LOGS_DIR=/tmp/wazo-test

To disable the `docker-compose pull` command and let `docker-compose run` do the job, do (used by zuul):

    WAZO_TEST_NO_DOCKER_COMPOSE_PULL=1

## Releasing a new version
